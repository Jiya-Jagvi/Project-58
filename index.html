        <p id="p1"> My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my homework. I am 12 years old and read in class 7th standard. Now I know very well that reading is a very good habbit which can make me a complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration, and instruction. It makes us discriplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life. </p>
